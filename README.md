# entities
In this project I will create an API with FastAPI.

The aim of the project is to learn and, hopefully, do something useful. Since 
I couldn't find any good idea to start the development but still I wanted
to practice, I decided to create this extremely abstract and unespecific 
project. In fact, at the moment of conceiveing it, it will only have two types
of object: Users and Entities. Those Entities do not really represent anything
in the real world... I hope that at some point I can make something useful out
of them. By now, I will keep them very minimal.

I am following this tutorial in order to carry out the project:
